### UNITADE.md Plugin for Obsidian v3.0.1 - Release Patch Notes

This v3.0.1 patch release focuses on minor enhancements, optimizations, and additional guidance for key features, improving overall functionality and user experience.

---

**Improvements and Fixes:**

- **README and Settings Tab Updates:** Adjusted the README and settings tab to reflect new extension "splitting" semantics, enhancing clarity on configuration and usage.
- **Asynchronous Language Loading (Locales):** Improved asynchronous loading for localization files, ensuring smoother, more reliable multi-language support across the plugin.
- **Error-Spamming Commentary:** Added a comment within the settings block about error-spamming behavior, with a note on how "error silencing" can mitigate unnecessary log entries in specific cases.
- **Code Editor Display Mode Update:** Resolved an issue with asynchronous extension loading in the code editor display mode, improving compatibility and display accuracy.
- **"Use Default Extensions" Note:** Added an in-app comment explaining the basic functionality of the "use default extensions" option, with references to the wiki for advanced details.
- **Case-Insensitive Mode Warning:** Introduced a prominent warning for case-insensitive mode. Due to potential risks, users are cautioned that enabling this mode may cause their vault to crash if applied recklessly. This mode can be safely disabled through the pluginâ€™s JSON config if issues arise.
- **Supported Versions and Issues Templates Update:** Updated supported version files and issue templates to ensure compatibility documentation aligns with the latest plugin functionality.
- **Release Semantics File:** Added a dedicated semantics file in the releases folder, summarizing key changes for reference.
- **"Add to Code Editor Settings" Option:** Introduced an option to add configurations to code editor settings, with a note that this and the core settings are not mutually exclusive but may conflict if both are active simultaneously.
- **Separator Symbol Update:** Adjusted the extension separator symbol from `;` to `>`, aligning with updated parsing rules and improving consistency across plugin versions.
- **Compatibility Module Fix:** Enhanced the compatibility module to eliminate "skipping" behavior following an error in replacement functions, improving reliability.
- **Default Extensions Rendering in Code Editor:** Updated the code editor to render default extensions first as code, followed by markdown formatting, for a clearer, more functional display.

This patch builds upon the v3.0.0 foundation, delivering critical updates to compatibility, user guidance, and interface consistency.
